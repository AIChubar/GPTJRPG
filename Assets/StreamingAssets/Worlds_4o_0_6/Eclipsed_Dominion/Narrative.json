  "story": "In the vast expanse of the Eclipsed Dominion, shadowy forests and murky swamps blanket the land. The skies are perpetually overcast, casting an eerie twilight over the world. This realm is a haven for dark creatures and malevolent beings, ruled by a series of powerful dark lords who vie for control and power. The land is rich with ancient ruins and forbidden knowledge, drawing ambitious souls who seek to harness its dark energies. However, all is not well in this dominion. The forces of light, led by the Celestial Vanguard, have begun to encroach on this dark haven. Their leader, Seraphael the Peacekeeper Angel, aims to cleanse the land of its darkness and bring forth an age of light and order. Tormund the Annihilating Titan and Elyndra the Shieldwielding Daeva are his most trusted lieutenants, each wielding immense power and unwavering resolve. The balance of power teeters on the edge, and the fate of the Eclipsed Dominion hangs in the balance.",
  "greetingGameMessage": "Welcome, dark one, to the Eclipsed Dominion. The shadows are your allies, and the night is your cloak. But beware, for the forces of light, led by Seraphael and his Celestial Vanguard, seek to extinguish your darkness. Steel your heart and sharpen your blade, for the battle for dominion begins now.",
  "defeatEndingMessage": "With Seraphael's fall, the Eclipsed Dominion is plunged into deeper darkness. The dark lords rise in power, and the forces of light retreat in despair. The land is now yours to command, and the age of shadows reigns supreme.",
  "gameOverMessage": "Defeated by Seraphael and his Celestial Vanguard, your dark ambitions are quashed. The Eclipsed Dominion is bathed in light, and the forces of darkness are scattered, leaderless and broken. The age of light dawns, and your name fades into obscurity."
