  "story": "The Cimmerian Isles of Ethereal Shadows were once lush with life and light, until an ancient curse shrouded the lands in perpetual darkness. Lor'thelar the Soul Reaper, an ominous Lich Lord, seeks to enslave the souls of all living beings, spreading despair and decay. Leading the Legion of Nihilus, Sylphora the Enigmatic, Guardian of Secrets, and Zephyrak the Tempest, the Storm Conjurer, aid Lor'thelar in his malevolent quest to plunge the world into eternal shadow.",
  "greetingGameMessage": "Welcome, brave adventurer, to the Cimmerian Isles of Ethereal Shadows, where darkness lurks at every corner and the whispers of the dead echo through the mist. Beware the malevolent grasp of Lor'thelar and his Legion of Nihilus, for your journey will be fraught with peril and shadow.",
  "defeatEndingMessage": "Through sheer determination and valiant courage, you have vanquished the scourge of darkness that plagued the Cimmerian Isles. Lor'thelar's tyranny has come to an end, and the light begins to pierce through the shadow once more. The world rejoices in your triumph, and peace is restored to these haunted lands.",
  "gameOverMessage": "Alas, the shadows have consumed you, brave adventurer. Lor'thelar's forces proved too powerful, and their darkness engulfs the Cimmerian Isles completely. The world descends further into despair as your valiant spirit is swallowed by the eternal night."
