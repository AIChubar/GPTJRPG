      "levelDescription": "Nestled within the heart of the Ethereal Shire of Shadows, the Whispering Glade is a serene and enchanting expanse of emerald grass. Here, the ancient trees whisper secrets of forgotten times to all who listen, their leaves rustling like delicate chimes. But beware, for beneath the lush glade lie treacherous holes that seem to shift and twist, threatening to swallow wanderers whole. Venture carefully, for the Shadow Cabal's sinister chants echo faintly in the breeze, and you may encounter the malign presence of Elara the Dark Conjurer, a deep elf death mage of immense power."

      "walkableTerrain": "dirt",
      "obstacleTerrain": "lava",
      "levelDescription": "The Virescent Wastes stretch out like a desolate wound across the landscape, with dark, barren dirt paths crisscrossed by bubbling lava pits. The ground is ruptured by fissures that speak of forgotten cataclysms, and the air is thick with the acrid tang of sulfur. Here, amidst the putrid sludge, lurks Virul the Malignant Sludge\u2014a plague ooze that spreads pestilence and decay with each toxic sway. Adventurers must tread warily, for the scorching breath of molten rock and the set traps of the Shadow Cabal\u2019s vile agents make this land hostile to even the most determined heroes."

      "levelName": "Twilight Fortress",
      "walkableTerrain": "light-dirt",
      "obstacleTerrain": "deep-dark-hole",
      "levelDescription": "Rising like an ominous landmark above the horizon, the Twilight Fortress is the epicenter of Morathos the Deathweaver's sinister dominion. The pale light-dirt paths barely provide purchase as they wind up the hill where the fortress stands, crumbling under the eternal twilight. Deep-dark-holes filled with spectral magic form portals to necrotic realms, manifesting the legendary power of Morathos to bend life and death to his will. This is where the once mighty archmage, now lich necromancer, casts his malevolent sorcery over the land. Only the bravest and most skilled champions dare to confront Morathos here, for the consequential battle is all that stands between the vibrant world and an eternity of shadow."
