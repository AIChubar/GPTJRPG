  "backStory": "In the labyrinthine heart of the Eclipsed Dominion, where nature's harmony spiraled into eerie nocturnal symphonies, Nyxia Thornvenom was born amidst twisting coils of shadow and luminescent venom. As a Dark Elf of enigmatic allegiance, Nyxia's intrinsic nature darkened with whispered prophecies of a domain overshadowed with eternal twilight. Infused with malevolent verdancy by Icarian roots scorched with vengeance, she was molded by a dynasty devoted to arcane shadow-wielding forbidden magick. Haunted by the pall of silence over the Empyreal Cascade, Nyxia quenched her seminal fury in a fathomless hunger to bend reality. With fidelity inexorably falling towards malevolent despotic supremacy, she embodies rebellion clenching intuit strides towards dominion wielded breath casting eclipses in her wake.",
