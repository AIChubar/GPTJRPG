The Nethergeist, a malevolent ghost from the void, seeks to plunge the realm into eternal darkness by harnessing the energy of the void. The Shadow Legion, led by the Nethergeist, consists of the cunning Auroraform, a radiant shapeshifter, and the lethal Shadowclaw Reaver, a tengu warrior skilled in the art of combat.",
