      "levelDescription": "The Obsidian Fields are a desolate expanse of jagged lava-rock, where the ground itself seems to pulse with malevolent energy. Deep-dark-holes are scattered throughout, ready to swallow the unwary traveler into the abyss. The sky above is perpetually shrouded in dark clouds, casting an eerie, dim light over the land. This forsaken place is a testament to the corruption that has seeped into the very bones of the Shattered Realms of Dusk."

      "levelDescription": "The Withered Grove is a twisted forest of dark-grass and gnarled, lifeless trees. Pools of stagnant water lie hidden among the shadows, concealing their depths and waiting to ensnare those who stray from the path. An unsettling silence pervades the air, broken only by the occasional whisper of the wind through the brittle branches. This grove was once a place of vibrant life, but now it stands as a grim reminder of the world's fall from grace."

      "levelDescription": "The Sanctum of Shadows is the heart of the protagonist's dark domain. Here, fractured-wall-platforms form a labyrinthine network of paths suspended over rivers of molten lava. The heat is oppressive, and the air is thick with the scent of sulfur. At the center of this infernal maze stands Seraphiel the Benevolent, the legendary Peacemaker Angel, flanked by Variel the Defender and Gorath the Unyielding. This is the final battleground, where the fate of the Shattered Realms of Dusk will be decided."
