      "levelDescription": "The Forsaken Forest is a twisted expanse of dark-grass, where the very ground seems to pulse with malevolence. Shadows cling to the gnarled trees, and deep-dark-holes litter the landscape, waiting to swallow the unwary. The air is thick with the scent of decay, and the whispers of lost souls echo through the gloom. This once-thriving woodland is now a place of despair, where even the bravest fear to tread."

This forsaken desert is a testament to the destructive power that has ravaged Valthoria, leaving nothing but desolation in its wake."
