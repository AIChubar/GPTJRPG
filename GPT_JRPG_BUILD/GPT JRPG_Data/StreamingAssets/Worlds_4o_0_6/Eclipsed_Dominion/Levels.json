      "levelDescription": "In the Whispering Marshes, the ground is covered in a thick, dark grass that seems to whisper secrets as you tread upon it. Treacherous waters form dark pools, hiding creatures of the deep ready to drag the unwary into their depths. The air is thick with mist, and ghostly apparitions drift silently through the fog. This is the realm where the dark lords test the resolve of those who dare to enter their domain."

      "levelDescription": "The Forsaken Ruins are a labyrinth of fractured wall platforms, remnants of a once-mighty fortress now crumbling into decay. Deep holes punctuate the landscape, ready to swallow those who misstep into the void below. Ancient glyphs glow faintly on the walls, whispering of forgotten power and forbidden knowledge. This level is a treacherous climb, where the forces of darkness guard their most sacred secrets."

      "levelDescription": "The Sanctuary of Shadows is the final stronghold of the Eclipsed Dominion, where the legendary Seraphael, the Peacekeeper Angel, resides. The ground is a dark dirt, warm to the touch from the rivers of lava that flow through the landscape, casting an eerie red glow. Here, amidst the oppressive heat and the ever-present threat of molten destruction, the ultimate battle for the fate of the Eclipsed Dominion will be fought. Seraphael and his Celestial Vanguard stand ready to cleanse the land of its darkness, but the shadows are not so easily extinguished."
